## Operation
To operate, simply copy the `package-lock.json` file from an ongoing or recent, Node, Angular or React project into the root directory. 

Then run:

```javascript
node index.js
```

A new file will be created inside the root directory titled `pnpm_package.json`. Copy this file inside of your project, rename to `package.json` and run:

```bash
pnpm i
```
